# [Awareness Bounty] Immediate sustainable alternatives to reduce the ecological impact of nfts

As the CryptoArt NFT market is exploding, there is a lack of clear information on the ecological impact of different approaches to NFTs. The purpose of this report is to help people who are interested in exploring more sustainable alternatives. 

The CryptoArt NFT Market (i.e. selling digital art on the blockchain) is worth at least $150M - and this excludes some of the largest marketplaces like opensea.io, (and this figure is quite heavily skewed of course, with the top artists earning the most).

Selling work on a blockchain can be a technically challenging task. For this reason, many platforms and websites have emerged, aiming to make this process as easy as possible for artists. Currently, many of these websites are based on the Ethereum blockchain, which is very ecologically costly. E.g. selling just a single-edition artwork on Ethereum has a carbon footprint starting at around 100 KgCO2, which is equivalent to a 1 hour flight (and depending on the platform, can reach a long-haul flight). Selling an edition of 100 works has a carbon footprint of over 10 tonnes CO2, which is more than the per capita annual footprint of someone in the EU - including all emissions from industry and trade.

By current estimations, a single Ethereum transaction consumes 48.14 kWh. For comparison, that’s just over one and a half days of energy consumption within the standard U.S. household. Now, multiply that by thousands of transactions daily and you can see how NFTs’ energy consumption takes its toll.

As far as production and sales go, a single Ethereum transaction to purchase an NFT consumes less energy than making a t-shirt. Also, NFTs aren’t the only goods bought with Ethereum, so even if the art went elsewhere, there would still be transactions eating up energy.

What may be more important to focus on is the impact of cryptocurrency in general. Some stats on Brightly.eco help bring this into focus explaining, “Bitcoin ‘mining’ already generates 38 million tons of CO2 per year, more than the carbon footprint of Slovakia.” Put in other terms, “The daily carbon footprint of Bitcoin is the equivalent of watching 57,000 hours of YouTube videos. And, its daily electricity usage is equivalent to the amount of power an average American household uses over the course of 25 days.”

*Why does an Ethereum transaction use this much energy?*

So the Ethereum blockchain currently uses Proof-of-work (PoW), which allows the Ethereum network nodes to agree on the state of information recorded on the blockchain, preventing certain kinds of economic attacks; most notably the double-spend problem. Proof-of-work is a viable solution to prevent double-spending on the blockchain, and this protocol requires miners to compete in a race to solve blocks on the chain. To solve a block, a miner needs to hash all the transactions inside a block with a random, nonsensical number (aptly named nonce) to solve a mathematical problem that can only be solved through trial and error. When Miners race to create a block, they will repeatedly use datasets that you can only get from downloading and running the full chain through a function.

For finishing a block, miners are rewarded with 2 ETH and all the transaction fees within the block. A miner may also get 1.75 ETH for an uncle block. This provides an incentive for miners to mine on the Ethereum network resulting in many machines fighting to solve a new block. The problem is that although potentially millions of miners may compete to solve a block, there is only one winner. The computation and energy consumption used by the rest of the miners who did not solve the block is essentially wasted.

## *Possible changes ahead*

### Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake 

There’s chatter about a move to a different system called, “Proof of Stake (PoS)” instead of the competition-based “Proof of Work (PoW)”. The PoS system would randomly choose one person to solve the block, eliminating the competition and the copious energy consumed in the process. The result would be a 99% reduction in energy consumed. That would bring down the carbon footprint of the average NFT to around 2.11 kg CO2, or about the same as mailing a physical piece of art cross-country.
Some are saying this new system could be implemented later this year or in 2022. There’s also the option to use a different chain besides Ethereum, then pick it back up when it’s moved to the PoS system. Furthermore, as more sources report on this energy consumption issue, some outlets are beginning to offer carbon offsets with each sale or purchase. 

Many Proof of Stake cryptoart platforms currently exist. They are smaller than their Proof of Work competitors, and have yet to generate the eye-popping sales figures seen in the news, but they offer a way to support NFT artists without absurd carbon emissions.

### Some of the ways to make it better right now:

#### Still using Ethereum:

Lazy minting: This is not necessarily dramatically better, around 2x, or maybe 3x less carbon footprint. This is done by not creating an NFT until its first purchase.

Sidechains: NFTs are minted on non-Ethereum PoS sidechains, but can be moved onto Ethereum later. If they are not moved, they can be hundreds of times more efficient.

Bridges: Are specifically for making one blockchain ecosystem compatible with another blockchain. This can also be referred to as interoperability and allows chains to interact which otherwise cannot. The advantage of this is you can go from ETH to another less impactful chain without losing the data minted.

Various Layer 2 (L2) scaling optimizations: Can be up to 100x more efficient.

#### Using other blockchains:

Instead of Ethereum, other blockchains are used. This can be up to hundreds of times better for the environment in terms of carbon footprint. Some of these chains include Algorand, Tezos, Polkadot, Hedera Hashgraph, and other PoS networks.

There are more sustainable routes emerging. As Christina Akopova, cofounder of crypto art platform Pixeos — on the DPoS-based EOS blockchain rather than Ethereum — notes: “If you don’t buy the #cryptoart you like cause it’s not on ETH, you are basically an ETH tokens collector, not an art supporter.”

Currently, these more sustainable platforms do not have the volume of their unsustainable counterparts (i.e. the Ethereum-based platforms). For this reason, collectors and sales are likely to be significantly lower too on the more sustainable alternatives. However, hopefully as more artists migrate to these emerging waters, this can encourage platforms, developers, investors and collectors, to bridge to develop more ecologically friendly and transparent platforms.

*The platforms themselves can be more transparent on the matter, what would be great to see from CryptoArt / NFT platforms regarding sustainability:*

A statement of values
A commitment to transparency, communication and guidance for CryptoArtists
A roadmap (other than “We hope ETH2 will resolve the issue when it’s released in a year or two" - e.g. alternate chains, side chains, lazy minting, layer 2 scaling which are currently in the process of supporting. Including bounties to PoS chains and wallets to create a solution to PoW etc)
A donation of proceeds to carbon credits or to subsidize the ecological footprint and their direct environmental impact


### General consensus:

NFTs themselves do not produce carbon emissions 
Ethereum currently has a carbon footprint associated with creating blocks by mining
ETH is what the majority of NFT marketplaces use, which is currently transitioning to PoS, which is expected in 2021 or 2022
NFT art platforms running on more energy efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks are currently the best solution for creating NFTs without impacting the environment with high energy use 
Offering PoS options would be a great course of action for existing NFT art platforms to take
Carbon offsetting your artwork is great, but be aware it’s not the fix, it’s just a small individual step you can take
